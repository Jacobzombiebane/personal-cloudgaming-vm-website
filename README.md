i got bored so i wanted to make a recreation of geforce now that is open source and is ment to run on proxmox as of writing this it could change 
my code isint perfect and its probably a buggy mess as of now if tehre is any code in it yet 
if there is acctual code in it that is done it may take some messing around with to get working i will try to add comments to the parts where it needs to be edited
